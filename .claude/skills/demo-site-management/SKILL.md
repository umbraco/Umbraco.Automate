# Demo Site Management

Manage the Umbraco.Automate demo site with automatic port discovery via named pipes.

## Command: $ARGUMENTS

Execute the requested demo site operation.

### Available commands

- **start**: Start demo site with DemoSite-Claude profile on dynamic port
- **stop**: Stop the running demo site
- **status**: Check if site is running and show port/pipe info
- **restart**: Stop and restart the demo site
- **open**: Open the demo site in default browser (discovers port automatically)

## Current Environment

- Working directory: !`pwd`
- Git branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "not in git repo"`
- Background tasks: !`echo "Check with /tasks command for active background tasks"`

## Implementation Guide

### For "start"

1. Check if already running using multi-method detection:
    - Try querying site address endpoint via named pipe (see "Query site address via named pipe" section)
    - Check if background tasks exist with "DemoSite" in description
    - If running, report and exit
2. Detect demo site path:
    - Read `Directory.Packages.props` and extract the major from the `Umbraco.Cms.Core` version (range lower bound or fixed, e.g. `[18.0.0, …)` or `18.0.0` → `18`)
    - Demo site path: `demos/v{major}/Umbraco.Automate.DemoSite`
3. If not running, start in background: `cd demos/v{major}/Umbraco.Automate.DemoSite && dotnet run --launch-profile DemoSite-Claude`
4. Wait 15-20 seconds for startup
5. Query site address endpoint via named pipe to get port and pipe name (see "Query site address via named pipe" section)
6. Report:
    - Task ID for later stopping (save this for future commands)
    - Port number (from site address endpoint)
    - Pipe name (format: umbraco.demosite.{branch-or-worktree})
    - Site URL

### For "stop"

1. Find background tasks related to demo site:
    - Look for tasks with "DemoSite" or "demo-site" in name
    - Extract task ID from task list

2. If task found:
    - Use TaskStop with the task ID to stop gracefully
    - Wait 2-3 seconds for cleanup

3. If no task found:
    - Report that no running demo site was found
    - Suggest checking with `/demo-site-management status`

4. Verify shutdown:
    - Try connecting to the last known port (should fail)
    - Check if background task is gone

5. Report results:
    - Success: "Demo site stopped (task ID: {id})"
    - Failure: "Could not find running demo site"
    - Note: Pipes are automatically cleaned up when process exits

### For "status"

Use multi-method detection to determine site status:

1. **Query site address endpoint**: Try querying via named pipe (see "Query site address via named pipe" section)
    - If successful, site is running and you have port info
    - If fails, continue to other methods

2. **Check background tasks**: Look for tasks with "DemoSite" or "demo-site" in name/output
    - If found, extract task ID

3. **Determine git context**:
    - Run `git rev-parse --git-dir` to check if worktree
    - If worktree, extract name from `.git/worktrees/{name}`
    - Otherwise use `git branch --show-current`
    - If no git, identifier is "default"

4. **Report comprehensive status**:
    - Running: yes/no (based on site address endpoint response)
    - Task ID: if background task found
    - Port: from site address endpoint
    - Pipe name: `umbraco.demosite.{identifier}`
    - Git context: branch name, worktree name, or "not in git repo"
    - Suggestion: How to start if not running, or how to connect if running

### For "restart"

Execute stop operation, wait 3 seconds, then execute start operation.

### For "open"

1. Check if demo site is running and get port info:
    - Query site address endpoint via named pipe (see "Query site address via named pipe" section)
    - If fails, report error: "Demo site not running. Start it with `/demo-site-management start`"
2. Launch default browser with discovered URL:
    - Windows: `powershell.exe -Command "Start-Process 'https://127.0.0.1:<port>'"`
    - Linux: `xdg-open https://127.0.0.1:<port>`
    - macOS: `open https://127.0.0.1:<port>`
3. Report:
    - Browser launched
    - URL opened
    - Note about certificate warning (self-signed HTTPS)
    - Credentials reminder: admin@example.com / password1234

## Query Site Address via Named Pipe

The demo site exposes a `/site-address` endpoint that returns port and pipe information as JSON.
Query it via HTTP over named pipes without needing to know the port:

**Using Node.js** (recommended, cross-platform):

```javascript
import http from "http";
import { execSync } from "child_process";

// Get pipe name from git context
function getIdentifier() {
    try {
        const gitDir = execSync("git rev-parse --git-dir", { encoding: "utf-8" }).trim();
        if (gitDir.includes("worktrees")) {
            return gitDir.split(/[\\\/]/).find((p, i, arr) => arr[i - 1] === "worktrees") || "default";
        }
        return execSync("git branch --show-current", { encoding: "utf-8" }).trim() || "default";
    } catch {
        return "default";
    }
}

const identifier = getIdentifier().replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\-_.]/g, "") || "default";
const pipeName = `umbraco.demosite.${identifier}`;
const socketPath = process.platform === "win32" ? `\\\\.\\pipe\\${pipeName}` : `/tmp/${pipeName}`;

const address = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    http.get({ socketPath, path: "/site-address" }, (res) => {
        let body = "";
        res.on("data", (chunk) => (body += chunk));
        res.on("end", () => (res.statusCode === 200 ? resolve(body) : reject(new Error(`HTTP ${res.statusCode}`))));
    }).on("error", reject);
});

// address = "https://127.0.0.1:44380"
```

**Using curl** (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
$identifier = (git branch --show-current).Trim() -replace '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-_]', ''
$pipeName = "umbraco.demosite.$identifier"
curl.exe --unix-socket "//./pipe/$pipeName" http://localhost/site-address
```

**Response format:** Plain text HTTPS address

```
https://127.0.0.1:44380
```

## Port Discovery Details

The demo site uses HTTP over named pipes for automatic port discovery:

- **Pipe naming**: `umbraco.demosite.<identifier>`
- **Identifier logic**:
    - Worktree: extracted from `.git/worktrees/<name>`
    - Main repo: current branch name
    - No git: `default`
- **Site address endpoint**: `/site-address` (returns HTTPS address as plain text)
- **HTTP transport**: Kestrel listens on both named pipe and HTTP/HTTPS
- **Implementation**: `demos/v{major}/Umbraco.Automate.DemoSite/Composers/NamedPipeListenerComposer.cs`

## Common Issues

### Pipe not found

- Demo site not running or still starting up
- Solution: Wait 15-20 seconds after start, or check status with `/demo-site-management status`

### Connection refused

- Pipe doesn't exist or connection failed
- Check that site is running: `/demo-site-management status`
- Verify pipe name matches git context (branch/worktree)

### Multiple instances conflict

- Each worktree/branch gets unique pipe name
- Main branch: `umbraco.demosite.<branch-name>`
- Worktree: `umbraco.demosite.<worktree-name>`
- No git: `umbraco.demosite.default`

## Success Criteria

**After start**: Report task ID, pipe name, port, and URL
**After stop**: Confirm process stopped successfully
**After status**: Show running state, port, and pipe connection details
